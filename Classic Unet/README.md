### U-Net

Unet is a popular image segmentation method used for semantic segmentaion. The architecture of Unet is shown below. This architecture was purposed in 2015 for biomedical image segmenation tasks. The Architecture and the original paper for U-Net is mentioned below

Unet relies on convolution operations for segmentation tasks. The U-Net model provides several advantages for segmentation tasks: first, this model allows for the use of global location and context at the same time. Second, it works with very few training samples and provides better performance for segmentation tasks.
